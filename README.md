# 🏠 ALX Listing App

## 📖 Project Description
The **ALX Listing App** is a modern web application built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**, designed to replicate the core structure of an **Airbnb-style property listing page**.

This project serves as the foundational setup for creating a dynamic, responsive, and scalable listing platform where users can view property details, images, and booking actions.

The goal of this milestone is to scaffold the project with a clean architecture, reusable components, and production-ready configurations.
